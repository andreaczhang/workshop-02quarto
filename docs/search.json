Create. This step copies content to your local machine, and inside your Rstudio you should see a tab named Git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: create your own public repository\nThis option is for those who are familiar with using GitHub and version controlled R project, and want to make a quarto website from scratch. (You are welcome to copy the files directly from the template repo into your own)\n\nCreate a new public repository\nClone the repository by clicking on the Code\nOpen a new project in Rstudio, choose version control\nPaste link, name your repo.\n\nThis will create an empty version controlled Rproject.

    "text": "2. Build the project\nNow you see a few files that have been downloaded in the folder where you Rproject is located. Before going into more details, let’s build your first webpage to see what happens!\nLocate index.qmd, open it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have a button render when you open the index.qmd file. Click on render. Do you see an HTML page in the Viewer panel?\nIf you do, that’s great! We’re ready for the next step!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Structure of a new quarto project\nLet’s understand what makes a minimal quarto website. These are the three most important files that you downloaded from the template repository:\n\n_quarto.yml stores the meta-data for the website, such as structure, layout and other information;\nindex.qmd is your homepage;\nstyles.scss provides a customized appearance of the website.\n\nYou’ve also downloaded .gitignore and a LICENSE. They are important, but not essential when building a website per se.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized R Ladies style\n\n\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, you do not need a style.css/style.scss to build a minimal quarto website. Quarto will use a default cosmo style when you don’t specify anything. We’ll see how to modify the theme in a few moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Authoring\nInside the index.qmd, you will see some information at the top of the page. This is the YAML header that specifies some basic information about this document.\nFor example, toc means table of content. By toc: true a list of sub-titles appear to the right of the page. In addition, you can specify information such as author and date.\n---\ntitle: \"Zero to Quarto Workshop\"\nsubtitle: \"Build your first quarto website (or something other cool things!)\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 2\n---\nBelow the YAML header, you can modify some text in markdown style.\n\n\n2.3 Configure the quarto project\nTo prepare for publishing the website with GitHub Pages, we need to do a few things in the quarto project before pushing all the files to GitHub.\nIn addition to GitHub Pages, there are also other ways to publish the website. Feel free to explore!\n\n2.3.1 output-dir\nIn _quarto.yml, change (or double check that) the project configuration to use docs as the output-dir:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nWhat this does is that when you click render, the built website with all the HTML files will be placed and updated in the docs folder. This step is essential when we configure GH pages setting to deploy from docs folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet output-dir to docs\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the _quarto.yml you downloaded from the workshop template, it already specified the output-dir: doc.\nWhen you build a website from scratch, by default, this is usually not the case. You’d need to add this line yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 nojekyll\nAdd .nojekyll to the root of the repository (i.e. same location where _quarto.yml is.\nYou can do this by (in Terminal)\ntouch .nojekyll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Terminal\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have Terminal panel next to Console, it can be opened by Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminal.\nAlternatively, you can also use your favorite command line software to navigate to the project and add .nojekyll there.\n\n\n\nFinally, commit all the files, and push everything to your remote repository on GitHub repository."

Configure GitHub pages, test deployment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you are more experienced, you can add more content until you’re happy before configuring the GH pages and test the website deployment. Yes, you can swap step 3 and 4 in this tutorial.\nI personally prefer to test the deployment early on to make sure it works!\n\n\nOn GitHub: go to Settings &gt; Pages, publish from docs of the main branch. Save.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should take less than 1 minute. Meanwhile, you can click around and check GitHub Action and deployment status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the deployment is successful, go to view deployment, and a successful website should be published.\nA URL should appear to tell you where the website is: it usually takes the form of https://your_username.github.io/your_reponame/\nIt is good practice to save it on the page where your repository is located, to the top right. This way you can find it easily in the future!"

There are so many things you can change; but let’s focus on some basics first.\n\nSite navigation and new pages\nWhat we have here is a very minimal one-page website. It is easy to add more pages; the question is, where to?\nQuarto offers a few options, and all of them can be specified in _quarto.yml file.\nThis is how the navigation style of our workshop webpage is specified (under navbar). Feel free to check the source code for this YAML file here.\n\nleft and right specifies the location on the navigation bar, where the tabs should appear;\nhref is the link of the document or URL to the page. It can be a quarto document in the same directory or sub-directory, but can also be a URL for any existing webpage online;\ntext is what the tab is named;\nicon provides the GitHub icon rather than text.\n\nwebsite:\n  page-navigation: true\n  title: \"Zero to Quarto Workshop\"\n\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n        \n      - href: setup.qmd  \n        text: Set up\n        \n      - href: tutorial.qmd\n        text: Tutorial\n        \n      - href: slides.qmd\n        text: Slides\n        \n    right: \n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/andreaczhang/workshop-02quarto\nFor more complex website such as courses or workshops, you might need other types of navigation to present information. Read more here to find out how you can do it.\n\n\nTheme\nThe appearance of the workshop template is inspired by the R Ladies colors. If you want to use a preset provided by quarto, it is perfectly fine - they look nice and professional already.\nThis is how you specify the theme. In _quarto.yml, instead of providing styles.scss file, use the theme name you prefer. For more themes, check here.\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\nAlternatively, feel free to modify the styles.scss to test different color palettes and font styles. Go wild!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom themes\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto has provided some guide on how to make custom themes. However, the easiest way to get started is to find an existing style you like, and try to modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunks\n\n\nImages\n\n\nMore on quarto websites\nUse list"
