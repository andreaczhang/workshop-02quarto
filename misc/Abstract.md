## Zero to Quarto: build your first Quarto website

Quarto is one of the most discussed topics in the R community for the past year. In the posit conf 2023 just happened a few weeks ago, there were 23 (!) talks on this open-source publishing system. You can build a personal or organisation website; a course or workshop website; a blog; a scientific report; a presentation; all with the possibility to display and execute code (R, Python, Julia), and for free. 

If you:

* don't know what quarto is yet, and want to find out more;
* heard of quarto somewhere, but don't know where to start (like me at the beginning);
* are an expert in quarto and want to share your experience
