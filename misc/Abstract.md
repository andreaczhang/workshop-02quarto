## Zero to Quarto: build your first Quarto website

Quarto is one of the most discussed topic in the R community for the past year. It was introduced in the 2022 Posit conf, and there are over 10 (*double check*) talks in the 2023 Posit conf just a few days ago. In short, you can build a personal or organisation website; a course or workshop website; a blog; a scientific report; a presentation; all with the possibility to display and execute code (R, python, Julia), and for free. 

If you:

* don't know what quarto is yet, and want to find out more;
* heard of quarto somewhere, but don't know where to start (like me at the beginning);
* are an expert in quarto and want to share your experience
