This tutorial outlines a minimal workflow so that you can build your own quarto website. For a more complete guide, please refer to the [official quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/).

::: callout-note

## This workflow requires:

* GitHub account to set up a public repository
* Rstudio (version xxx)
* Quarto (version xxx)

:::


## 1. Set up a version controlled quarto project

This can be broken down into a few steps:

### 1.1 Create a new public repository

It has to be public.

### 1.2 Link your R project to the repository

Open 


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## How do you know the repository is correctly set up?

You can try to modify the `README.md` locally, then commit and push to remote (online repository). Refresh the webpage, if you see the remote repository is synced, that means the version control works fine.

:::

## 2. Build the project

### 2.1 Structure of a new quarto project


###Â 2.2 Authoring

Try to write something in the `index.qmd` file, press Render button, and see what happens.


### 2.3 Configure the quarto project

In `_quarto.yml`, change the project configuration to use `docs` as the `output-dir`: 

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Then add `.nojekyll` to the root of the repository. Can do this by (in **terminal**)

```
touch .nojekyll
```

Push everything to your repository.



## 3. Configure GitHub pages, test deployment

::: {.callout-tip}

When you are more experienced, you can add more content until you're happy before configuring the GH pages and test the website deployment. I personally prefer to test the deployment early on to make sure it works!

:::


Go to Settings > Pages, publish from `docs` of the `main` branch.

Can check GitHub Action and deployment status.

After the deployment is successful, go to `view deployment`, and a successful website should be published. 



## 4. Add content

Now this is a big topic. There are so many things you can change; but let's focus on some basics first.

### Site navigation


### Add a new page


### Theme



### Code chunks


### Images


### More on quarto websites 

Use list




## (Optional) Add interactivity 

This is a topic of using quarto extension.
