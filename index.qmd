# Welcome!

Quarto is one of the most discussed topics in the R community for the past year. In the posit conf 2023 that just happened a few weeks ago, there were 23 (!) talks on this open-source publishing system. You can build a personal or organisation website; a course or workshop website; a blog; a scientific report; a presentation; all with the possibility to display and execute code (R, Python, Julia), and for free.


If you:

* don't know what quarto is yet, and want to find out more
* heard of quarto somewhere, but don't know where to start
* are an expert in quarto and want to share your experience

then this workshop is for you!
