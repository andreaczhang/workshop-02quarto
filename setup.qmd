Here are a few things you need to build and deploy a quarto website (or project) with GitHub Pages.

### Rstudio 

Your Rstudio should be downloaded **later than 2022** for quarto to run. However, it would be good to update it to have the latest features!


### GitHub

1. Set up a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com) if you do not have an account yet.
2. Configure git on your machine so that you can use it in Rstudio.

### Quarto

Download the latest version (1.3) of Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

You might need to re-start Rstudio.
